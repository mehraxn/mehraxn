# Hello World! 👋

I'm **Mehran**, a Computer Engineering student passionate about **software development** and problem-solving through code.  

🌱 I’m currently mastering **C** and **Python**, while also building strong skills in **JavaScript** and **Git/GitHub** to strengthen my development workflow.  
💡 I specialize in **backend development**, which I’m making stronger day by day, while also learning **frontend development** to grow into a full-stack developer.  
🔧 I’m also skilled in **Computer Architecture** and have experience with **hardware description languages** like **Verilog**.  
🚀 My goal is to keep learning, contribute to open-source, and grow into a versatile and impactful software engineer.
